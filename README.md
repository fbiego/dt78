DT78 Smartwatch Reverse Engineering

## Arduino ESP32

The [`arduino code`](https://github.com/fbiego/dt78/blob/master/dt78_ble_client/dt78_ble_client.ino) creates a client on the ESP32 board that connects to the smartwatch

## Android App

Since this watch only supports notification from a few app in the Wearfit 2.0 app, I modified this code [`DT78-Alerts-Android`](https://github.com/fbiego/DT78-Alerts-Android)forked from [`mitchwongho/ESP-Alerts-for-Android`](https://github.com/mitchwongho/ESP-Alerts-for-Android) to send notifications to the app
